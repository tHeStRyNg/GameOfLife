**Game of Life Project README**

**Project Overview**
------------------

The Game of Life is a simulation-based game that allows players to experience the challenges and opportunities of life. The project aims to develop a comprehensive game that simulates various aspects of life, including character creation, simulation logic, random events, and gameplay loops.

**Phases**
--------

1. **Planning Phase**
	* Tasks:
		+ Define game mechanics and simulation logic
		+ Determine platform requirements (Windows, macOS, Linux)
		+ Identify project scope and timelines
	* Sub-tasks:
		+ Research and analyze existing life simulation games
		+ Determine game genre and style
	* Estimated time: 5 days
	* Estimated cost: $2,500 - $4,000

2. **Game Development Phase**
	* Tasks:
		+ Implement game structure using Pygame
		+ Develop simulation logic for each life stage (childhood, adolescence, adulthood)
		+ Add event handling for random events and character creation
		+ Improve graphics and sound effects
	* Sub-tasks:
		+ Enhance visuals for each life stage
		+ Add background music and sound effects
		+ Prepare installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
	* Estimated time: 25 days
	* Estimated cost: $12,500 - $20,000

3. **Testing Phase**
	* Tasks:
		+ Playtest the game multiple times to identify areas for improvement
		+ Develop automated testing framework
		+ Conduct thorough testing of game mechanics and simulation logic
	* Sub-tasks:
		+ Identify bugs and crashes reported by players
		+ Fix issues and improve game stability
		+ Verify installer functionality and troubleshoot any issues
	* Estimated time: 10 days
	* Estimated cost: $5,000 - $8,000

4. **Documentation and Tutorials Phase**
	* Tasks:
		+ Write documentation to help players understand game mechanics
		+ Develop tutorials to introduce new players to the game
	* Sub-tasks:
		+ Create comprehensive guide covering character creation, simulation logic, and gameplay loops
		+ Include tips and tricks for maximizing player enjoyment
		+ Create interactive lessons or video guides showcasing key features and strategies
	* Estimated time: 3 days
	* Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500

5. **Final Polish and Deployment Phase**
	* Tasks:
		+ Prepare installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
		+ Finalize game packaging and distribution channels
	* Sub-tasks:
		+ Verify installer functionality and troubleshoot any issues
		+ Set up marketing materials and promotional campaigns
	* Estimated time: 5 days
	* Estimated cost: $2,500 - $4,000

**Project Timeline**
--------------------

| Phase | Estimated Time | Estimated Cost |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Planning | 5 days | $2,500 - $4,000 |
